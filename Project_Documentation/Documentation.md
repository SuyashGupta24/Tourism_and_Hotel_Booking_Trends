## 📌 Project Title

**Tourism and Hotel Booking Trends Analysis**

---

## 📖 Project Description

This project focuses on understanding how people travel and book hotels over time, especially in India. It brings together two major data sources:

- **Hotel Booking Data**: Includes information like booking status, country of visitors, arrival dates, average daily rate (ADR), number of guests, and more.
- **Indian Tourism Statistics**: Contains data about the number of **domestic** and **foreign tourists** visiting different Indian states over the years.

Together, these datasets help us analyze and **visualize real-world travel behavior**.

The main aim of the project is to provide a **user-friendly and interactive dashboard** using **Streamlit**, a Python framework. This dashboard enables anyone — even without coding skills — to:

- 📊 Visualize booking trends over time.
- 🌍 Explore how many people visit from different countries.
- 💰 Understand seasonal changes in hotel pricing (ADR).
- 🚗 Analyze the pattern of domestic vs. foreign tourist inflows.
- 🔍 Filter by hotel type, month, year, etc., for deeper insights.
