## 📌 Project Title

**Tourism and Hotel Booking Trends Analysis**

---

## 📖 Project Description

This project focuses on understanding how people travel and book hotels over time, especially in India. It brings together two major data sources:

- **Hotel Booking Data**: Includes information like booking status, country of visitors, arrival dates, average daily rate (ADR), number of guests, and more.
- **Indian Tourism Statistics**: Contains data about the number of **domestic** and **foreign tourists** visiting different Indian states over the years.

Together, these datasets help us analyze and **visualize real-world travel behavior**.

The main aim of the project is to provide a **user-friendly and interactive dashboard** using **Streamlit**, a Python framework. This dashboard enables anyone — even without coding skills — to:

- 📊 Visualize booking trends over time.
- 🌍 Explore how many people visit from different countries.
- 💰 Understand seasonal changes in hotel pricing (ADR).
- 🚗 Analyze the pattern of domestic vs. foreign tourist inflows.
- 🔍 Filter by hotel type, month, year, etc., for deeper insights.

## 📊 Data Analysis using Pandas

One of the core pillars of this project is **data analysis**, and for that, we use the powerful Python library **Pandas**. Here's what you will learn and apply using Pandas:

---

### 🔹 1. Loading and Exploring Data

Pandas allows us to easily load CSV files and explore their contents.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv('dataset/hotel_bookings_cleaned.csv')

# View first 5 rows
print(df.head())

# Check data types and null values
print(df.info())
You will understand how to inspect the dataset, look for missing values, data types, and anomalies in your columns.

🔹 2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Cleaning is essential before any analysis. You'll learn to handle missing data, remove duplicates, and filter out irrelevant rows.

python
Copy
Edit
# Remove rows with missing hotel names or ADR values
df_cleaned = df.dropna(subset=['hotel', 'adr'])

# Remove duplicates
df_cleaned = df_cleaned.drop_duplicates()
This ensures the data is ready for meaningful analysis.

🔹 3. Grouping and Aggregation
You’ll use groupby() to analyze trends over time or by category — e.g., number of bookings per month or average ADR per hotel type.

python
Copy
Edit
# Group by month and calculate average ADR
monthly_adr = df.groupby('arrival_date_month')['adr'].mean().reset_index()
This is very useful to create summarized reports and visualize patterns.

🔹 4. Filtering and Querying Data
Pandas provides easy ways to filter rows and apply custom logic.

python
Copy
Edit
# Filter bookings from Portugal only
portugal_data = df[df['country'] == 'PRT']

# Filter where bookings were cancelled
cancelled = df[df['is_canceled'] == 1]
You'll learn how to extract subsets of data based on real-world business queries.

🔹 5. Creating New Columns
Derived columns help enhance insights. You'll learn to create new metrics like total revenue, length of stay, etc.

python
Copy
Edit
# Add a column for total nights stayed
df['total_nights'] = df['stays_in_weekend_nights'] + df['stays_in_week_nights']
🔹 6. Merging & Joining Datasets
You’ll also combine the hotel booking data with Indian tourism data using merge().

python
Copy
Edit
# Merge hotel and tourism data on year and month
merged_df = pd.merge(hotel_df, tourism_df, on=['Year', 'Month'], how='inner')
This allows you to correlate domestic/foreign tourist trends with booking behavior.

✅ Summary
By the end of this project, you'll be comfortable with:

Reading and cleaning datasets

Aggregating and summarizing large datasets

Extracting business-relevant insights

Merging multiple sources of data

Preparing data for dashboards and visualizations

Pandas will become your go-to tool for any data wrangling task in real-world scenarios.
